People here tend to be kind, work hard, and tell stories, especially the legends of the village, that speak the mighty deeds of theirpatron: St. Talwin, the legendary (to them) Half-Orc Paladin. What you'll find: names, description, premade adventure text for locations and npcs, several adventure hooks for various quests all interconnected, systems and rules to run and determine the outcome of some of the players' action (and the consequence they will have on the village's economy and quality of life, which will dynamically change), rules to randomly generate hawkers' merch and variant rules for shopkeepers.",
